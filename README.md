# Electric-Skateboard

##Hardware
the sensors I used are:
*Current and Voltage sensor
*RGB LED indicator that I use to alert low battery or any other use
*OLED Display to see all data like speed, cruse, limit, lights and more
*GPS to determine speed, direction and display clock
*Pressure sensor to sense if I am still on the skateboard and other aplications
*Buzzer to buzz on low voltage
*Relay switch to control lights
*RC Receiver to control throttle with the remote
*Teensy 3.1 as a micro controller, this was the only one strong enough to hold all the sensors
